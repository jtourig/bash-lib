# bash-lib

This is my collection of shell functions and utility scripts, mostly for doing bioinformatics on the (IU HPC)[https://kb.iu.edu/d/alde] clusters.

Scripts in `utils/` are executable - see the code or run with `-h`/`--help` for usage info

Files ending in `*.bash` contain functions that can be sourced

I highly recommend (Greg / GreyCat's Wiki)[http://mywiki.wooledge.org/] starting with (BashGuide)[http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide] and (The Bash Hackers Wiki)[https://wiki.bash-hackers.org] for learning how to write sane and maintainable shell scripts while avoiding (bad code)[http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls].  Shell syntax is a minefield and there's a lot of poor code out there pretending to be 'right' or 'good enough' !

I also generally try to follow the (Google Shell Syle Guide)[https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html] for readability \(except I prefer tabs displayed as 4 spaces\) *ducks*
